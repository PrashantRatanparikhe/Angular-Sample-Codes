# Angular Sample Codes

A collection of Angular sample projects and snippets demonstrating common patterns, techniques, and features in Angular applications.

> Languages detected in this repository (approximate):
> - TypeScript

This repository is intended as a learning and reference resource for developers who want short, focused examples of Angular features such as components, services, routing, forms, HTTP, observables, testing, and build/deployment patterns.

## Repository scope

This repo contains multiple Angular sample apps/snippets intended to illustrate concepts rather than a single production application. Use the samples to learn, experiment, and copy patterns into your own projects.

If you want me to make the README specific to the exact projects inside this repository, I can inspect the repository tree and update the README with exact project names and run instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended) — e.g., Node 18+
- npm (comes with Node) or yarn
- Angular CLI (optional but convenient):
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```
- A code editor such as Visual Studio Code

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrashantRatanparikhe/Angular-Sample-Codes.git
   cd Angular-Sample-Codes
   ```

2. Inspect the repository to find example projects. Many repositories with multiple Angular samples place them in subfolders; change into the sample's folder to proceed:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/sample-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the sample:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   # or
   npm start
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:4200 in your browser (or the port shown in the output).

## Common commands

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start development server:
  ```bash
  ng serve
  ```
- Build for production:
  ```bash
  ng build --prod
  ```
- Run unit tests:
  ```bash
  ng test
  ```
- Run end-to-end tests:
  ```bash
  ng e2e
  ```
- Lint:
  ```bash
  ng lint
  ```

If a sample uses a package manager script (package.json "scripts"), prefer using those scripts for consistency:
```bash
npm run start
npm run build
```

## Suggested folder structure

If you want to organize or extend the repo, consider the following layout:

- /projects/ — each folder contains a separate Angular sample project
  - /projects/sample-01/
    - package.json
    - src/
    - angular.json (or workspace config)
  - /projects/sample-02/
- /snippets/ — small, focused code snippets (service.ts, component.ts, etc.)
- /docs/ — additional notes, how-tos, or screenshots
- README.md

## What you'll find here (examples)

Examples you might expect in an Angular sample repo (if not present, consider adding them):

- Component basics and lifecycle hooks
- Template-driven and reactive forms
- Dependency injection and services
- HttpClient usage and interceptors
- Routing, lazy loading, route guards, and resolver examples
- Observables, Subjects, and RxJS patterns
- State management (simple service-based state or NgRx examples)
- Unit testing with Jasmine/Karma and simple E2E with Cypress/Protractor
- Build and deployment hints (ng build, environment files, AOT)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A suggested process:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your change: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`
3. Add or update examples, documentation, and tests.
4. Commit and push your branch to your fork.
5. Open a pull request describing the change and why it helps learners.

Guidelines:
- Keep samples focused and small — one concept per sample is ideal.
- Include README or short notes for each sample that explain purpose and run steps.
- Add tests where practical.

If you'd like, I can open a pull request adding this README to the repo for you.

## Testing & CI

- Prefer lightweight unit tests for each sample.
- Add GitHub Actions if you want automatic checks on PRs (npm install, ng build, ng test).
- Example GitHub Action basics:
  - Checkout
  - Setup Node
  - npm ci
  - npm run build
  - npm test

Add a LICENSE file to the repository (MIT is common for example repos). Example MIT header:

Thanks — tell me whether you want the README committed to the repo (I can open a PR) or updated to include project-specific run commands after I inspect the repository tree.
