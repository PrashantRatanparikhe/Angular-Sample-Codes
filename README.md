# Hi

A small React sample project / component set living in the `Angular-Sample-Codes` folder of this repository.

> Note: I couldn't read your repository contents due to a temporary API access error. This README is a general, ready-to-edit template. If "Angular-Sample-Codes" stands for something specific (for example "HTML-to-Image", "High-Throughput Integration", etc.), tell me and I’ll update the descriptions and examples accordingly.

## Overview

`Angular-Sample-Codes` is a React sample that demonstrates one or more UI components and example pages. Use this module as a learning reference or starting point for small demos and experiments.

## Features

- Small, focused React examples
- Clear folder structure for components, assets, and tests
- Scripts to run, build, and test locally

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended, e.g. 18+)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

From the repository root (or inside the `Angular-Sample-Codes` folder if it has its own package.json):

```bash
# from repo root (adjust if Angular-Sample-Codes is a subproject with its own package.json)
cd Angular-Sample-Codes
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Development

Start the dev server (adjust script name if different):

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown) to view the demo.

## Build

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The output will be in the `build/` or `dist/` folder depending on your setup.

## Tests

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

## Folder structure

A suggested structure — modify to reflect your project:

- Angular-Sample-Codes/
  - public/            # static files (index.html, favicon)
  - src/
    - components/      # reusable React components
    - pages/           # demo pages
    - hooks/           # custom hooks (if any)
    - styles/          # CSS / SASS files
    - assets/          # images, icons
    - App.jsx
    - index.jsx
  - package.json
  - README.md

## Usage

Describe how to use the components or demo pages. Example:

- Navigate to `/examples/feature-a` to see Feature A.
- Import components from `./src/components`:
```jsx
import { MyComponent } from './components/MyComponent';
```

If you want, I can:
- Update this README to match the actual contents of Angular-Sample-Codes (I can re-try reading the repo now),
- Add usage examples taken from specific files,
- Create this README file in the repository for you (I can push a branch and open a PR). Which would you like next?
